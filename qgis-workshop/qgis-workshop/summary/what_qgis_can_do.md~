What QGIS Can Do
================
There is of course a whole load more that QGIS can do which we don't have time to cover here.

This includes:
- connecting directly to your data in a database
- showing data from other only sources, including OGC-compliant web services such as WMS (Web Mapping Service) and WFS (Web Feature Service)
- publish data which can be consumed by websites (using QGIS server)
- carry out geo-processing operations, such as *buffer* and *clip*
- carry out spatial analysis operations, such as calculating distances, finding points which fall within a polygon, and statistical analysis
- create print-quality maps for publishing
