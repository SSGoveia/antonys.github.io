Files and Data
==============

GIS data comes in two main flavours: *vector* and *raster*.

## Vector data
Representation of objects such as points, lines and polygons by, at the simplest level, a set of geographical coordinates. Vector data usually includes attribute values for each object - for example a road number, a village name or the population of province. Vector data comes in many forms, including:
- shapefile (ESRI)
- KML
- TAB file (MapInfo)
- database table
- csv (comma separated values) file

Vector data can be manipulated, queried, styled, published, processed, combined, using GIS tools, or in some cases, standard data processing tools such as spreadsheets and databases.

## Raster data
Rasters are images - for example satellite or aerial photographs, or images of maps. They are often used for map backgrounds, but can also be analysed at the pixel level, to, for example, identify land use or cover. We're not going to work with raster data in this workshop.

Specific GIS tools tend to have their own proprietary formats for files which define the maps they produce - these files contain pointers to the data, styles, etc. For example, ESRI's Arc uses .mxd files, which QGIS uses .qgs - in QGIS this is called a *Project file*.
