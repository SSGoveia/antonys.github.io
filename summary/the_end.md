[*MapAction*](http://www.mapaction.org) is a UK-based humanitarian NGO providing mapping to support disaster response. Its teams work alongside UN and other agencies in the field, both in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, and in capacity building, training and support missions. While it uses ArcGIS for its core disaster response work, it uses QGIS for training and support work.

MapAction runs a dedicated project, *RAMP* (Resilient Action for Mapping Preparedness), which has developed training resources and GIS methodologies which have been rolled out in Zambia, Sri Lanka, and Democratic Republic of Congo. RAMP works with partner agencies including UN OCHA and the World Bank.
