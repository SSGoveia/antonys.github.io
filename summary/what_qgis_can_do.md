What QGIS Can Do
================
There is of course a whole load more that QGIS can do which we don't have time to cover here.

This includes:
- connecting directly to your data in a database: PostGres, SpatiaLite and MS SQL data can all be loaded directly from the `Load Data` buttons
- showing data from other only sources, including OGC-compliant web services such as WMS (Web Mapping Service) and WFS (Web Feature Service): also from the `Load Data` buttons
- publish data which can be consumed by websites: using QGIS server
- carry out geo-processing operations, such as *buffer* and *clip*: using the `Vector` menu
- load and export most spatial data file formats: using `Add Vector Layer` and `Save As`
- convert data into different projections: using `Save As` 
- carry out spatial analysis operations, such as calculating distances, finding points which fall within a polygon, and statistical analysis: using the `Tools` options in the `Vector` menu
- display, analyse and process raster data: using the options on the `Raster` menu
- download and work with OpenStreetMap data: using `Vector > OpenStreetMap`
