Exercise 2: Adding Style to Data
================================

Now that you have your data loaded, you can add some style so that it is represented on the map in a useful way. We're going to look at two or three styling options, then give you a chance to try them out.

First we'll look at the data itself. Look for the `Open Attribute Table` in the toolbar, and click it. You'll see all the data which was in the CSV file appearing in the table - so although you have created a map layer, all your source data is still available. We'll return to this later and see what else you can do with this table, but for now we are going to focus on style.

1. Double-click on the layer name, and click the `Style' option - you will see a screen like this []
2. This is where you control how the layer appears on the map.

The first decision you need to make is how you want your styling to be driven - this is set using the button at the top left of the style dialogue.

The options are:
1. Single symbol: to show all the points in the same way (for example to mark all settlements with a red circle)
2. Categorized: to show points differently based on the value of one of the fields (for example to show settlements with a different coloured circle depending on the province they are in)
3. Graduated: to show points differently depending on a classification (for example to show settlements based on the population banding they fall into)

In this exercise, we are going to use the `Graduated` option, but try to have a look at the others later.

1. Set the button in the top left of the dialogue to `Graduated`.
2. In the `Column` field, select `Pop_1_1` - this is the column we will use to drive the style.
3. Choose a `Colour Ramp` to represent the data, and leave the other fields as they are for now.
4. Click `OK`
5. Your layer should now look something like this []

Styling needs careful thought to make sure that your map represents the data in a way which is meaningful to the user - this is cartography. In practice this usually means trying out options, and seeing what looks best - then getting some user feedback (ie from your neighbour!). Spend a few minutes trying out styles.
