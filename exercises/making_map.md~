Exercise 4: Making a Map
========================

When you are happy with the way your map looks, you can export it to a printable or viewable form.

## The Quick Way
The quickest way of doing this is to save what you can now see in QGIS as an image - this will allow you to print it, include it in a report, send it by email, etc.

To do this:
1. Go to `Project > Save as Image`, select a file type in the bottom right of the dialogue, and enter a file name.
2. An image will be created of the current view of the map in the right-hand QGIS panel.

## The Proper Way
What you have created may be enough, but it is very basic - it has no title, legend, scale, north arrow etc. If you want to add all these things, you will need to use the *Print Composer* - this is a dedicated layout engine within QGIS which will help create a map with all the appropriate additions.

This tool takes a little getting used to - but once you have mastered it, you will be able to produce high-quality standalone maps.

1. Go to `Project > New Print Composer`, then click `OK' to auto-generate a title.
2. Add a map to the blank canvas -
