Architecture and plugins
========================

QGIS has a core programme, with the option to extend its functionality by installing *plugins*. Some of these are automatically installed with the programme, while others are available from the QGIS Plugins Repository. This contains hundreds of plugins, including some flagged as *Experimental* - bear in mind that these may or may not do what you want them to.

Some handy plugins include:
- OpenLayers: brings in background mapping from OpenStreetMap, Google, Bing and others
- InaSAFE: a tool for modelling the impact of natural hazards
- HeatMap: creates a heat map from point data
- TimeManager: creates animations from time series data
- GroupStats: a kind of mini pivot table creator

Plugins are managed from the QGIS `Plugins` menu - you can choose which ones to install, and which ones to activate.

The *Settings* option allows you to choose whether to show 'expermental' plugins in the list of available plugins, and also whether to check for updates to plugins when QGIS loads - it's recommended that you activate this, as many plugins are updated regularly (especially the experimental ones).

> *Exercise:* Open up QGIS, configure the UI as described earlier, then choose a few plugins to install (including OpenLayers). Note that the information page for each plugin shown in the Plugins Manager should also tell you how to access it in QGIS - sometimes it's the `Plugins` menu, and sometimes plugins create their own menu and/or toolbar.
