How the workshop will work
==========================

After the introduction, we'll run through the exercises one by one. Get as far as you can with them, and please ask if you have any questions or problems. Don't worry about getting things to look perfect, you can do that later... the aim is simply to familiarise you with some of the basic concepts of GIS in general and QGIS in particular, so that you can use it in your work.

The data and a PDF of this document will be distributed on a flash drive, or can be downloaded from http://

Work on your own or with a partner if you prefer.
