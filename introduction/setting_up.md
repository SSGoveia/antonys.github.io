Setting up QGIS
===============

## Installation
If you haven't already, download and install the appropriate version of QGIS from [http://www.qgis.org/](http://www.qgis.org/).

Note that you new versions are released every few months - it's not normally necessary to upgrade, although new features are added all the time. New versions are installed as a standalone application, so you can have more than one version installed if you like.

## Setting Up
A couple of tips to get started once you have QGIS installed.
- To make the icons smaller and get more screen space, go to `Settings > General > Icon size`
- To change the language of the UI, go to `Settings > Locale`, then check `Override system locale`, and choose the locale to use (you will need to restart QGIS to see the effect)
- Right-click in the toolbar area, and uncheck any of the toolbars you  are not using to free even more screen space - for example you won't need `Digitizing` in this exercise
