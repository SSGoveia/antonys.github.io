This Workshop
=============
After the introduction and discussion of some basic GIS concepts, we'll run through the exercises one by one. Get as far as you can with them, and please ask if you have any questions or problems. Don't worry about getting things to look perfect, you can do that later... the aim of the workshop is to get familiar with some of the ideas and techniques of GIS in general and QGIS in particular, so that you can use it in your work.

Work on your own, or with a partner if you prefer, but try to make sure that you get some 'hands-on' experience of QGIS during the workshop.
