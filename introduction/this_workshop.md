This Workshop
=============
After the introduction, we'll run through the exercises one by one. Get as far as you can with them, and please ask if you have any questions or problems. Don't worry about getting things to look perfect, you can do that later... the aim of the workshop is to familiarise you with some of the basic concepts of GIS in general, and QGIS in particular, so that you can use it in your work.

The website where this workshop is hosted will continue to be available after the conference, so come back to it later if you want.

Work on your own, or with a partner if you prefer, but try to make sure that you get some 'hands-on' experince of QGIS during the workshop.
