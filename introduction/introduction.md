Getting Started with QGIS: Introduction
=======================================
This workshop will introduce you to QGIS, run through some exercises to get you started with the basics, and point you in the direction of more resources and information. We'll use some humanitarian-related data from Unicef in Goma, DRC in the exercises.

The workshop documentation can be found at:
